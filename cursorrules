Review goals:
- Prioritize security, correctness, and reliability over style-only nits
- Catch auth/z bugs, data loss, concurrency/race conditions, and injection risks
- Ensure inputs are validated, errors handled, and sensitive data is never logged
- Flag risky dependency/version changes and breaking API/DB schema changes

Scope and focus:
- Focus on application code, tests, infra-as-code, CI/CD changes
- Ignore generated/build artifacts and vendor folders
- When performance is relevant, flag N+1 queries, unnecessary I/O, hot-path allocations

Expectations for the review:
- Be concise and actionable; include code suggestions where possible
- Summarize major risks; don’t restate diffs
- Link to relevant docs or standards if needed (lint rules, security guides)
- Call out missing tests for critical logic and edge cases

Style and consistency:
- Prefer existing project patterns; follow existing naming and module structure
- Ensure logging is structured, non-PII, and at appropriate levels
- Confirm timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers are in place for network calls

Approval guidance:
- Block on security/correctness issues and flaky or missing critical tests
- Non-blocking for minor style nits if linters/formatters will catch them
